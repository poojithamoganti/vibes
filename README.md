What if there's an app for kids to learn usefull content from social media instead of doom scrolling which may contain senstive, adlutary and foul content ?

This app mainly foucuses of two parts:

1. Only shows users intrested kid's content by using a powerful recommendation system
2. Only allows users to upload clean content, by using Google cloud vision api to filter out clutter.
